WIP


What works:
1. currently installs conky from central repo and creates a menu (.desktop) file for it which the package did not do for me.

WIP:
2. would like it to generate a decent default conky profile also; need to research and come up with one
	reqs: CPU temp, drive space, maybe something like nload to monitor net bandwidth?
