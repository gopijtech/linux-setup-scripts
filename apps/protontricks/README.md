installs protontricks from source

if you are unfamiliar with proton, it is a wine wrapper created and maintained by Steam for the purpose of running Windows games on Linux.

Wine has winetricks to simplify installation of certain windows dependencies in the scope of a given folder (aka WINEPREFIX)

Similarly, proton has protontricks. Technically you can use winetricks on a proton install but protontricks does add a few niceities that make it worthwhile (at least to me).
