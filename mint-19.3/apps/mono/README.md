This is for installing Mono under Linux

To use this script:

```
git clone https://github.com/zpangwin/linux-setup-scripts.git;
find linux-setup-scripts -type f -iname '*.sh' -exec chmod a+rx "{}" \;;
cd linux-setup-scripts/mint-19.3/apps/mono/install-mono.sh

```
Last tested : N/A
Last status : should work since GitExtensions script calls this and that one works.
